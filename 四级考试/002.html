    <p>After finishing high school, many students are faced with the dilemma of whether to attend college at home or abroad.
        For my part,I prefer to continue my study abroad.

        One major advantage of studying or living in a different country is that it can provide a great opporunity to expand our horizons.
        By getting to know people from different cultural backgrounds, we can learn about the way they think and act.And this can help enhance our ability to see things 
        from a fresh perspective.
        In contrast,students who choose to pursue further study  at home may have limited knowledge of the outside world.

        Another advantage of overseas study is that we are more able to become selfreliant.
        As we all know,it takes independence to live abroad for we are forced to things, such as cooking and renting an apartment,all by ourselves.And those who are equipped with this quality are highly
        likely to be more competitive and contribute more in the workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on what is discussed above,it is reasonable that studying abroad is a better choice for high-school graduates.
