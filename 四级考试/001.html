    <p>The dilemma facing many fresh graduates these days is whether to join a state-owned business or to work for joint venture.
        From my perspective, the former is a better choice.</p>
    <p>The reason why I am in favour of taking a job in a state-owned enterprise is twofold.
        For one thing,such a decision mean lifetime job security.The world of work is changing rapidly.so people today cannot rely on a job for life, especially in times of economic recession that may cause
        joint ventures to cut jobs.By contrast,employees of state-owned enterprise.This is because the employees there often do not need to work overtime.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on the arguments above.I would say that it is more advisable to work in a state-owned business than in a joint venture after college.
